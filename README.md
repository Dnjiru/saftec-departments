#### A Web Application for Adding Departments and Sections, Date of current version: May 2019.
#### By **David Mwaniki Njiru**
## Description
This is Week 3 Independent Project learning Java programming using Spark framework.

The purpose of this Independent Project is to demonstrate your level of understanding of the various concepts that you have covered in the content throughout the week.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
The Web App is built on Java Spark. All you need to run is a browser and internet. However, if you have the code locally, it can run on your computer browser.

## Behavior Driven Development(BDD)
Before writing this code, I focused first on the behaviours that I would want to see in our final application. I considered what the program should do, thought through possible scenarios when the user would encounter when interacting with the application.

As a user , I would like to :

Create a Departments. You can create more than 1 department.
Create staff members within the departments with different roles and responsibilities.
See all the staff members created under all departments in the home page.
See a list of departments created
I cannot add the same staff member in more than 1 department. Prompt a message pointing out one cannot if they try and a failure message.
See the list of staff in each section/department and their roles and responsibilities
CRUD capabilities on both the staff member objects and the departments

## Known Bugs

## Technologies Used
Java Spark.

## Support and contact details
It is unlikely that you run into any issues as you use the application. But incase you do, please drop me an email at mr.mwaniki@gmail.com.
